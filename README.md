# Example Project
This is an example project for the LiveDataLab Project-Based Learning Platform.

### Setting up the project
To work on this project, you should first link your Github account within the LiveDataLab dashboard [TODO: Add link to website here]. This allows you to leverage the submission infrastructure where we execute your code in the cloud.

After linking your Github account, you should fork this repository to create your own version. Next, in that forked repo, go to `settings` -> `webhooks` -> `Add webhook`. Enter `ADD LINK HERE` into the payload url, and select `application/json` as the `Content type`. Then click the `Add webhook` button at the bottom.

You're all set up and ready to go! You can now clone your forked repo to your computer and begin working. When you're ready to make a submission, all you need to do is push to your fork. After doing so, you can navigate back to the LiveDataLab dashboard to see the results.

### Project Specifics
This project contains two source files: `main.py` and `mymath.py`. `main.py` is wrapper code for testing the functions within `mymath.py`. Your goal is to implement the four functions in `mymath.py`: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
